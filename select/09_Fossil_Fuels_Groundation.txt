We should all aim to live a life of sustainability
Instead of burning Earth's ressources while polluting the seas
They're ripping out the seeds that grow naturally
Inside our Earth yeah
Leaves the land scarred and wasted for centuries
With no accountability at all

Mankind's greed can never be pleased
Watch them building pipelines across the seas
Now tell me

Let us stand up for the future
Looking back over thousands and thousands of years
We must set the stage proper
For the coming generation

Get off your fossil fuels you foods yeah
Wake up and think ahead young dread
Protecting the future from this injustice
Honor this Earth as is life depends
Ahhh-uhhh-aaahhh-uuuuh
Ayyyyy-yay

There is no such thing in this world as clean coal energy
While politicians keep presenting fracking technology
It's not just global warning its about the air we breach
And the food we eat yeah
The sun, wind, and water give and give and give
In a steady rockin' riddim

Mankind's greed can never be pleased
Watch them building pipelines across the seas
Now tell me

Let us stand up for the future
Looking back over thousands and thousands of years
We must set the stage proper
For the next generation

Get off your fossil and fuels you fools yeah
Wake up and think ahead young dread
Protecting the future from this injustice
Honor this Earth as if all life depends
Ahhh-uhhh-aaahhh-uuuh
Ayyyyy-yay
